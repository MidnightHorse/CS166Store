# Smart Retail System

This Java application is programmed to be an efficient tool to help managers and administrators to view stocks and order missing items. The database runs on MySQL, hosted through Apache NetBeans framework. The relational database interacts
in real-time with the supplier to order to check availability to order new items.

Functionality-wise, it can also serve as an ordering application for customers, giving them digital access to goods provided in the store's database. The customer will need to manually login through the application
and can seamlessly place an order window at the chosen store.
